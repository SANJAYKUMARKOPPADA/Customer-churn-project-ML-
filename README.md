# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Machine Learning.
Customer churn means customers who stop using a company’s services.
The model is trained using historical customer data to predict whether a customer will churn or not.

## Project Type
Minor Project – Machine Learning

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
- Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- Type: Tabular data
- Target column: Churn
- Dataset is included in this repository

## Project Files
- `Minor project(ML).ipynb` – Complete project implementation
- `dataset.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing
- `README.md` – Project description

## Project Workflow
1. Loading the dataset
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Encoding categorical data
4. Splitting data into training and testing sets
5. Training Machine Learning models
6. Evaluating model performance
7. Generating predictions

## Results
The trained model is able to predict customer churn with good accuracy.
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

## Execution
The project was developed and executed locally using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
No deployment is done.
